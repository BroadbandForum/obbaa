# ONU Alarm Handling

## Alarms from ONU to vOMCI (defined in G.988)

The ONU alarms are associated with a specific OMCI ME instance that may
have 0, 1 or multiple alarms (up to 224).

When an alarm changes state, the ONU sends a notification with the
current state of all the alarms that exist in the ME instance related to
the alarm that changed.

This means that in a notification sent by the ONU can be used to
identify one or more alarms that changed its state simultaneously with
several other alarms that kept the previous state. The OMCI notification
doesn\'t explicitly state which ONU alarm(s) have changed.

## vOMCI function handling of ONU alarms

The vOMCI function receives the ONU alarm\'s status then to send
notifications that reflect alarm changes. Because of this, the vOMCI
function is required to store the status of the ONU\'s alarms.

Everytime an alarm message is received from the ONU, the vOMCI function
checks all the ONU\'s alarms status received and verifies which alarms
have changed its state. Then, the notification with the alarms that
changed are sent to vOLTMF.

## Report ONU alarms to the vOLTMF

Alarms received from the ONU are forwarded to the vOLTMF using the topic
dedicated to NOTIFICATIONS. The alarm will be encoded using ietf-alarm
([RFC8632](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8632)) style
notifications.

Generic Sample Alarm Notification
```
Msg {
 header {
  msg_id: "1"
  sender_name: "vomci-vendor-1"
  recipient_name: "vOLTMF"
  object_type: ONU
  object_name: "ont1"
}
body {
  notification {    
   event_timestamp: "2022-01-09T13:53:36+00:00"
   data: <data>
  }
}
}
```

Where \<data\>

```
{
  "ietf-alarms:alarm-notification": {
    "resource": "/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name='eth0']",
    "alarm-type-id": "bbf-obbaa-ethernet-alarm-types:loss-of-signal",
    "alarm-type-qualifier": "",
    "time": "2022-01-09T13:53:36+00:00",
    "perceived-severity": "major",
    "alarm-text": "example alarm"
  }
}
```

## Implemented alarms types

[RFC8632](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8632) uses YANG
identities to identify the possible types of alarms that an entity can
generate. All alarm types must be derived from the ***alarm-type-id***
entity defined in *ietf-alarms.yang*.

**List of implemented alarms:**

|**Entity**|**Alarm**|**Alarm type ID entity**|
|PPTP Ethernet (ITU-T G.988 clause 9.5.1)|UNI LOS|bbf-obbaa-ethernet-alarm-types:loss-of-signal|
|ANI (ITU-T G.988 clause 9.2.1)|Low received optical power|bbf-hardware-transceiver-alarm-types:rx-power-low|
||High received optical power|bbf-hardware-transceiver-alarm-types:rx-power-high|
||SF (Signal Fail)|bbf-obbaa-xpon-onu-alarm-types:signal-fail|
||SD (Signal Degraded)|bbf-obbaa-xpon-onu-alarm-types:signal-degraded|
||Low transmit optical power|bbf-hardware-transceiver-alarm-types:tx-power-low|
||High transmit optical power|bbf-hardware-transceiver-alarm-types:tx-power-high|
||Laser bias current|bbf-hardware-transceiver-alarm-types:tx-bias-high|

At the time of implementation, there were no identities derived from
ietf-alarm:alarm-type-id which could be applicable to model some of
these alarms. As such the alarm identities used by OB-BAA are defined in
the OB-BAA specific modules (bbf-obbaa-ethernet-alarm-types and
bbf-obbaa-xpon-onu-alarm-types).
