      "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
       supporting the Broadband Forum requirements on management of
       ITU-T Passive Optical Network (PON) interfaces as defined in
       ITU-T G.984.x, G.987.x, ITU-T G.989.x and ITU-T G.9807.x. As
       such, this module is specific to access network equipment (e.g.,
       BBF-specified Access Nodes and FTTdp DPUs).
       
       Specifically, this module contains common type definitions.
