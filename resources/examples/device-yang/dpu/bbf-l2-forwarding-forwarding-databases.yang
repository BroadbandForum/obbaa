         The strategy is to offer the same flexibility as in IEEE: 
          - Allows at one extreme that each VLAN has its own FDB, 
            this allows the same MAC address to be learned 
            independently within different VLANs. 
          - Allows at the other extreme that the system has one FDB 
            shared by all VLANs, this allows the same MAC address to 
            be learned only once over all VLANs.
          - Allows everything in between, i.e. an FDB for a set of 
            VLANs, a 2nd FDB for another set.
         To support this concept it is possible to have a multiple 
         forwarders assigned to a single FDB.";
