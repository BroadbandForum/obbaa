       Network Unit (ONU) and that are specific to the xPON 
       technology.
       
       This identity is abstract and SHOULD NOT generally be used for
       alarms. If used to define an alarm that was not known at
       design time, it MUST be qualified with an alarm type qualifier
       string. This practice, however, should be generally avoided to
       ensure all possible alarms are known at design time.";
