       Note that this grouping uses fairly typical descendent
       node names such that a stack of 'uses' statements will
       have name conflicts.  It is intended that the consuming
       data model will resolve the issue (e.g., by wrapping
       the 'uses' statement in a container called
       'grpc-client-parameters').  This model purposely does
       not do this itself so as to provide maximum flexibility
