1,/if:interfaces/if:interface/if:name,string,default,current,"A short name uniquely describing an interface, eg ""Eth1/0"".",,,See [RFC2863] for the definition of the ifName object.,,0,20-11-2019
two,/if:interfaces/if:interface/if:description,string,,current,"A textual description of the interface.    A server implementation MAY map this leaf to the ifAlias  MIB object.  Such an implementation needs to use some  mechanism to handle the differences in size and characters  allowed between this leaf and ifAlias.  The definition of  such a mechanism is outside the scope of this document.    Since ifAlias is defined to be stored in non-volatile  storage, the MIB implementation MUST map ifAlias to the  value of 'description' in the persistently stored  datastore.    Specifically, if the device supports ':startup', when  ifAlias is read the device MUST return the value of  'description' in the 'startup' datastore, and when it is  written, it MUST be written to the 'running' and 'startup'  datastores.  Note that it is up to the implementation to    decide whether to modify this single leaf in 'startup' or  perform an implicit copy-config from 'running' to  'startup'.    If the device does not support ':startup', ifAlias MUST  be mapped to the 'description' leaf in the 'running'  datastore.",,,,,0,6/14/2018
3,/if:interfaces/if:interface/if:type,dataTypeWrong,,current,"The type of the interface.    When an interface entry is created, a server MAY  initialize the type leaf with a valid value, e.g., if it  is possible to derive the type from the name of the  interface.    If a client tries to set the type of an interface to a  value that can never be used by the system, e.g., if the  type is not supported or if the type does not match the  name of the interface, the server MUST reject the request.  A NETCONF server MUST reply with an rpc-error with the  error-tag 'invalid-value' in this case.",,,,,0,6/14/2018
